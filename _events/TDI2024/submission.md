# Submission Guidelines
We solicit research and innovation papers that present ideas, proof of concepts, use cases, challenges and results from a variety of topics relevant to the secure and reliable identity management solutions. We accept different kinds of submissions:
- Original contributions, also in preliminary form, which will be included in an open-access post-proceeding volume of [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](https://ceur-ws.org/), indexed by both Scopus and DBLP;
- Already published works, which will not be included in the post-proceedings volume.

Papers must be submitted in English and in PDF format, by following the CEURART template (1-column format). The LaTeX and Word version of the template can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x6k5X7dMdD_MKRDQAeSKfr0-lnL4kjOK/view). An [Overleaf version](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/wqyfdgftmcfw) of the template is also available.

Depending on the length, submissions are classified as:
- Short papers: 5-9 pages including bibliography and appendices;
- Regular papers: 10-12 pages including bibliography and appendices.

Submitted papers will undergo a single-blind review process, thus anonymization is **not** required.

Submissions must be made to the [EasyChair conference management system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tdi2024).

Please note that at least one authors of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and is expected to (physically) present it.
