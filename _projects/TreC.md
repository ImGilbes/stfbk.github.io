TreC (Cartella Clinica del Cittadino) aims at the development of an on-line platform providing citizens with the ability to carry out a number of functionalities related to the personal health records (such as read, update, and delegation). The platform also enables citizens to communicate with medical institutions, their doctors, and other citizens.
